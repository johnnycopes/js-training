# JS Training

## What is this?

This repository is a robust answer to the question "how do I get better at JavaScript?" Here you'll find a curated collection of JavaScript problems aggregated from a number of excellent resources, including:

- __[The Advanced Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-advanced-web-developer-bootcamp/)__ :
an online course by the teachers of Rithm School, a web development bootcamp in San Francisco, CA

- __[Eloquent JS](http://eloquentjavascript.net/)__ : a free book about computer programming with focus on the JavaScript language by Marijn Haverbeke

- __[Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)__ : a free, open-source online curriculum to learn web development led by Quincy Larson

- __[JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/)__ : a free online course where you build small projects using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by Wes Bos

- __[JavaScript: The Hard Parts](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-hard-parts/)__ : an online course that gets into the nitty-gritty of how JavaScript works under the hood by Will Sentance

## How do I set this up?

The project structure is intended to be as straightforward as possible so you can spend more time writing code and less time establishing a place to write it.

At every level of the folder structure there's an ```_index.html``` file (named with an underscore so that it will always be first) and several JavaScript files (```.js```).

1. Clone the repository onto your computer
2. Open the project in your text editor/IDE
3. Navigate into any folder and inside its ```_index.html``` file, write the name of the filepath of any JavaScript file in the ```src``` attribute of the ```<script>``` tag
4. Launch that same ```_index.html``` file in your browser and open the developer tools console. Save your work in the JS file and refresh the browser to see your code appear in the console. Note that some challenges may require HTML elements like buttons, in which case you'll see them in the corresponding ```_index.html``` page you've opened in the browser
5. In every file, there are a variable number of challenges and some code that may be uncommented or commented. Uncommented code is starter code; commented code is there to test your solution

## How do I find challenges on specific JavaScript concepts?

The files are organized by source not topic, so the best way to find practice problems of a given concept is to either search by file or globally (```ctrl + p``` and ```ctrl + shift + f``` in Visual Studio Code, respectively) for the term you're interested in ('closure', 'reduce', 'async', etc.)

## Can I contribute to this?

For sure! These are the resources that I've found to be most useful in my own learning, but if have any challenges that helped you strengthen your programming chops, please feel free to message me or submit a PR.
