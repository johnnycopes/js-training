# JS Training

## What is this?

This repository is an answer to the question "how do I get better at JavaScript?" Here you'll find a curated collection of JavaScript problems aggregated from a number of excellent resources, including:

### __The Advanced Web Developer Bootcamp__ : an online course hosted on Udemy by the teachers of Rithm School, a web development bootcamp in San Francisco, CA

### __Eloquent JS__ : a free book about computer programming in general but with focus on the JavaScript language by Marijn Haverbeke

### __Free Code Camp__ : a free, open-source online curriculum to learn web development led by Quincy Larson

### __JavaScript 30__ : a free online course where you build small projects using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by Wes Bos

### __JavaScript: The Hard Parts__ : an online course hosted on Front End Masters that gets into the nitty-gritty of how JavaScript works under the hood by Will Sentance

## How do I set this up?

The project structure is intended to be as straightforward as possible so you can spend more time writing code instead of dealing with setting up a place to write it. 

At every level of the folder structure there's an ```_index.html``` file (named with an underscore so that it will always be first in the file list) and a variable number of JavaScript files (extension ```.js```).

1. Clone the repository onto your computer
2. Open the project in your text editor/IDE
3. Navigate into the desired folder and write the name of the desired JavaScript file in the ```src``` attribute of the ```<script>``` tag
4. Launch that same ```_index.html``` file in your browser and open the developer tools console. Save your work in the JS file and refresh the browser to see your changes appear in the console. Note that some problems may require HTML elements like buttons, in which case you'll see them in the corresponding ```_index.html``` page you've opened in the browser
5. In every file, there are a variable number of challenges and some code that may be uncommented or commented. Uncommented code is starter code; commented code is code you can uncomment when working on the problem to test what you've written

## How do I find challenges on specific JavaScript concepts?

The files are organized by source, not topic, so the best way to find practice problems of a given concept is to either search by file or globally search (```ctrl + p``` and ```ctrl + shift + f``` in Visual Studio Code, respectively) for the term you're interested in ('closure', 'reduce', 'async', etc.)

## Can I contribute to this?

For sure! These are the resources that I've found to be most useful in my own learning, but if have any challenges that helped you strengthen your programming chops, please feel free to message me or submit a PR.
