# JS Training

## What is this?

This repository is a robust answer to the question "how do I get better at JavaScript?" Here you'll find a curated collection of JavaScript problems aggregated from a number of excellent resources, including:

- __[The Advanced Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-advanced-web-developer-bootcamp/)__ : an online course by Colt Steele and the teachers of Rithm School, a web development bootcamp in San Francisco, CA

- __[Eloquent JS](http://eloquentjavascript.net/)__ : a free book about computer programming with focus on the JavaScript language by Marijn Haverbeke

- __[Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)__ : a free, open-source online curriculum to learn web development led by Quincy Larson

- __[JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/)__ : a free online course where you build small projects using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by Wes Bos

- __[JavaScript: The Hard Parts](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-hard-parts/)__ : an online course that gets into the nitty-gritty of how JavaScript works under the hood by Will Sentance

- __[JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms Masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass/)__ : an online course focusing on computer science topics using JavaScript by Colt Steele

## How do I set this up?

1. Clone the project repository
1. Navigate into the newly-created directory and install all dependencies by running npm install
1. Navigate into the project folder
1. To open the application: run npm start. This will run the app locally in a new browser tab pointing to [`http://localhost:4200/`](http://localhost:4200/)
3. In `sandbox.js`, either copy and paste code from a subdirectory or directly import content using JS Module syntax. In every file, there are a number of challenges and some code that may be uncommented or commented. Uncommented code is starter code; commented code is there to test your solution

## How do I find challenges on specific JavaScript concepts?

The files are organized by source not topic, so the best way to find practice problems of a given concept is to either search by file or globally (```ctrl + p``` and ```ctrl + shift + f``` in Visual Studio Code, respectively) for the term you're interested in ('closure', 'reduce', 'async', etc.)
