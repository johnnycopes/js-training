/*
A Fibonacci series is a series of numbers where each number is derived by summing the previous two numbers together.

i.e. 0,1,2,3,5,8 ...

Write an algorithm that will print the first n numbers in a Fibonacci series.

Example: If the input equals 10 the output will equal 0,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55.

// console.log(fibonacci(10)); // 0,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55.
